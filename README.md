# P2P Rentals - Blockchain-based Peer-to-Peer Rental Platform

## Description

P2P Rentals is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that enables direct peer-to-peer rental transactions without intermediaries. The platform allows users to list their items for rent and enables others to rent these items by making secure payments in APT tokens. The smart contract automatically handles payment transfers, rental duration tracking, and availability management, creating a trustless environment for rental agreements.

The contract features two core functions: `create_listing` for item owners to list their rentable items with daily rates, and `rent_item` for renters to secure items for specified durations. All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency, immutability, and automated execution of rental agreements.

## Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the sharing economy by creating a decentralized, trustless, and globally accessible rental marketplace. We aim to eliminate the need for centralized platforms that charge high fees and control user interactions. By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a world where anyone can monetize their underutilized assets directly with peers, regardless of geographical boundaries.

We strive to build a community-driven ecosystem that promotes sustainable consumption, reduces waste through shared resources, and provides equal opportunities for both asset owners and renters to participate in the global sharing economy without traditional barriers and excessive fees.
